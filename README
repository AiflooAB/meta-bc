HOW TO BUILD LINPHONE / FLEXISIP USING YOCTO / BITBAKE

- Edit the conf/bblayers.conf file in your build directory and append to the BBLAYERS list the path to the meta-bc directory
- Edit the conf/local.conf file in your build directory and add the following line:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "linphone flexisip"
- Now build your image normally (bitbake core-image-minimal or other)
- You can also skip the two previous steps and only compile linphone or flexisip directly with bitbake (bitbake linphone; bitbake flexisip)

HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL LINPHONE / FLEXISIP USING BELLEDONNE COMMUNICATIONS IPK REPOSITORY

- First make sure your image is built with opkg. To do so, add the following into the local.conf file in your fsl-<version>/ build/conf directory (and also add some free space for download/install ipk purposes):
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " opkg"
IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE="204800"
- Create the file in /etc/opkg/bc.conf in your hardware
- Add the following into the file:
src/gz all http://linphone.org/snapshots/ipk/all
src/gz cortexa9hf-vfp-neon http://linphone.org/snapshots/ipk/cortexa9hf-vfp-neon
src/gz cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-mx6qdl http://linphone.org/snapshots/ipk/cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-mx6qdl
src/gz wandboard_solo http://linphone.org/snapshots/ipk/wandboard_solo
- Run the following commands:
$ opkg update
$ opkg install linphone
$ opkg install flexisip
